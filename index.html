             The iPhone 13 series announced earlier this week went on pre-orders yesterday in the first wave of markets. The smartphones were expected to ship in these regions starting September 24 for pre-orders, but the delivery dates of some Pro and Pro Max models have been pushed to next month - between October 6 and October 11.

            Except for the Gold color variant with 256GB storage, all iPhone 13 Pro Max variants will start shipping between October 6 and October 11. But that's not the case with the iPhone 13 Pro since the 128GB and 256GB models in Silver, Graphite, Gold, and Sierra Blue colors will ship starting September 24 in addition to the 512GB trim in Gold and Sierra Blue shades.

            The delay in delivery of some iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models doesn't necessarily mean they are doing better than their predecessors. It could just mean that Apple didn't have enough stocks available to meet the initial demand.
